Through the above data analysis, we found out meaningful insights and solutions / for our hotel problems and for success.

There are three main implications. // Preventing cancellations / Selling vacancies / Increasing sales.

The first one is About Preventing cancellations, 
From our ML results, we can / not only predict cancellations and more accurate expected sales, but also prevent many cancellation cases. 
For example,
The longer the lead time, the higher the cancellation rate for customers in Europe, / and the higher the accommodation cost, the higher the cancellation rate for customers / in non-European countries. 
Based on this, we are considering taking, different strategies in cost and lead-time for Europe and Non-Europe countries, respectively, to reduce cancellation.

Second one is about selling Vacancies,
Through the Random Forest Classifier model, we found out that the lead time was shorter for revisiting customers. 
So, if we promote our rooms with a short lead time to the revisiting customers, we can reduce the number of vacancies and It will have positive effects on our sales. 
Devising lock-in strategies and promotions for revisiting customers like strengthening the membership system might be useful ways for this.

The last implication is about Increasing sales
The Multiple linear regression model we made, can help us to forecast short-term sales.
And based on this prediction results, we can plan more realistic goals in sales.
and also, from our EDA and regression results, we developed various marketing strategies. 
Like this example.
customers who book through the GDS channel and who book hotels during the peak season of July and August have higher ADR. By considering stronger association with the GDS channel and focusing on increasing sales in peak season, we can increase our hotel’s sales. 

In addition, we were able to select the main targets / and figured out features of them for marketing strategies from our association rules. It also might help us make strategies to increase sales.
First, we found out that / Couples often didn’t eat at hotels and possibilities of increasing sales from the fact.
Second, Teams with children and corporate customers were high value customers. So, co-operating with multiple companies and increasing child comfortability and parents’ satisfaction will be efficient ways for increasing our sales.
And last, From our results about countries. We need to consider promoting city hotels in France and Germany. In contrast, in england, we need to aim promotion for resort hotels. 

Like this, With the help of analysis and ML results, we can forecast short-term sales. And based on this, we will be able to plan more realistic goals in sales. 
Moreover, we discovered more valuable customers, / And also identified their preferences, which is useful for setting up our marketing strategy. 
From this, we can possess overwhelming competitive advantages.
