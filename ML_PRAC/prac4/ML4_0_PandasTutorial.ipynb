Pandas is an open source library built on top of NumPy. It allows for fast analysis and data cleaning and preparation. It also has built-in visualization features. It can work with data from a wide variety of sources. Simply speaking you can think of pandas as an extremely powerful version of Excel, with a lot more features. We will learn some of the key features on Pandas like the following: \n","\n","* Series\n","* DataFrames\n","* Missing Data\n","* GroupBy\n","* Merging,Joining,and Concatenating\n","* Operations\n","* Data Input and Output"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"NELha_TWDfgQ"},"source":["### If you don't have pandas, you'll need to install pandas by going to your command line of terminal and using \n","#### conda install pandas"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"nX-ld_VlDfgR"},"source":["## Series\n","The first main data type we will learn about for pandas is the Series data type.

What differentiates the NumPy array from a Series, is that a Series can have axis labels, meaning it can be indexed by a label, instead of just a number location.
